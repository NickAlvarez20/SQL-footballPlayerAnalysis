## Project Name
SQL Football Player Analysis
## About
This project analyzes an NFL draft picks dataset using SQL queries to extract insights about player draft positions, colleges, and teams. The dataset includes information on players selected in the NFL draft, such as their pick number, name, college, drafting team, and position.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need a SQL database management system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) installed on your system.
No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This SQL Football Player Analysis includes these features:

-Creation of a picks table to store NFL draft data (pick number, name, college, team, and position)

-SQL queries to calculate average, maximum, and minimum pick numbers

-Advanced queries using HAVING, CASE, AND, and OR clauses to filter and categorize draft data

-Analysis of draft picks by college, including filtering colleges with early draft selections

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/SQL-footballPlayerAnalysis.git`

1. Set up a SQL database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).
   
2. Import the dataset by running the SQL script (football_analysis.sql) to create the picks table and insert data.
   
## Usage
Run the SQL script (football_analysis.sql) in your SQL client or database management tool:

1.Load the script into your SQL database.

2.Execute the queries to analyze the NFL draft dataset. Example queries include:

-Calculating the average, maximum, and minimum pick numbers.

-Filtering colleges with average pick numbers below 28.

-Categorizing picks by quality using a CASE statement.

-Filtering picks by college or pick number ranges using AND and OR conditions.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Develop proficiency in writing complex SQL queries for data analysis

-Understand how to structure and query relational databases

-Apply SQL to real-world datasets to derive meaningful insights

-Enhance skills in using SQL clauses like HAVING, CASE, AND, and OR for advanced data filtering
